            <p>
              In addition to saving money on your utility bill, water
              conservation helps prevent water pollution in nearby lakes,
              rivers, and local watersheds. Conserving water also prevents
              greenhouse gas emissions associated with treating and distributing
              water.
              <br />
              <br />
              Conserving water can also extend the life of your septic system by
              reducing soil saturation and reducing pollution due to leaks.
              Overloading municipal sewer systems can also cause untreated
              sewage to flow to lakes and rivers. The smaller the amount of
              water flowing through these systems, the lower the likelihood of
              pollution. In some communities, costly sewage system expansion has
              been avoided by community-wide household water conservation.
              <br /><br />
              Clean, fresh water is a limited resource. With all the severe
              droughts happening in the world, the limited supply of fresh water
              is becoming one of our most precious resources. Every person on
              earth needs water to survive. Without it, many of us would get
              sick and even result in death.

          <h2>Water is a scarce and finite resource.</h2>

          <p>
            Believe it or not, while 71% of our earth is covered in water, only
            3% of it is fresh water. Out of that 3%, only 1% is available, the
            remaining 2% being locked in glaciers and ice caps. <br /><br />
            This means that 1% alone must sustain an entire planet of
            inhabitants including humans, animals, and plant-life alike. Fresh
            water is not a renewable resource. The more the population grows,
            the less we will have if we donâ€™t conserve it.
          </p>
          <h2>Water is necessary for life</h2>
          <p>
            The reason to conserve water is as obvious as this. We need water to
            survive. We need it not only to sustain us but our way of living.
            The food that we eat, the crops, the livestock, all depends on water
            to be viable for future consumption. <br /><br />
            In the United States alone, half of all the water that the country
            has is used to raise animals. That means only half is for human
            consumption, some of which is not even for drinking. Without enough
            water, we would have to focus on other sustainable food sources,
            like insects and bugs. While that is possible, it is always better
            to focus on what you can do to sustain our current way of living for
            the long haul.
          </p>
          <h2>Water grows food</h2>
          <p>
            Fruits and vegetables, as well as other produce, require water to
            grow. But if the area is suffering from a drought, how will the food
            grow?
            <br /><br />This can make sustainable living a difficult challenge
            as sectors that suffer from drought will become useless as plants of
            any kind will not be able to grow. Without water, the population
            will starve to death.
          </p>
          <h2>It protects our ecosystem and wildlife</h2>
          <p>
            Humans are not the only species on Earth that requires water for
            survival. In fact, every species on this planet needs water to live
            and survive. <br />
            Without water, the aquatic life will stand no chance of survival. It
            is highly important that we save water that is essential to our
            sustainability.
