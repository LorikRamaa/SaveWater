            Water is an inorganic, transparent, tasteless, odorless, and nearly
            colorless chemical substance, which is the main constituent of
            Earth's hydrosphere and the fluids of all known living organisms (in
            which it acts as a solvent). It is vital for all known forms of
            life, even though it provides no calories or organic nutrients. Its
            chemical formula is H2O, meaning that each of its molecules contains
            one oxygen and two hydrogen atoms, connected by covalent bonds. Two
            hydrogen atoms are attached to one oxygen atom at an angle of
            104.45°. "Water" is the name of the liquid state of H2O at standard
            ambient temperature and pressure.
            <br /><br />
            It forms precipitation in the form of rain and aerosols in the form
            of fog. Clouds are formed from suspended droplets of water and ice,
            its solid state. When finely divided, crystalline ice may
            precipitate in the form of snow. The gaseous state of water is steam
            or water vapor. Water moves continually through the water cycle of
            evaporation, transpiration (evapotranspiration), condensation,
            precipitation, and runoff, usually reaching the sea.
            <br /><br />
            Water covers 71% of the Earth's surface, mostly in seas and oceans.
            Small portions of water occur as groundwater (1.7%), in the glaciers
            and the ice caps of Antarctica and Greenland (1.7%), and in the air
            as vapor, clouds (formed of ice and liquid water suspended in air),
            and precipitation (0.001%).

            <p>
              Water (H<sup>2</sup>O) is a polar inorganic compound that is at
              room temperature a tasteless and odorless liquid, nearly colorless
              with a hint of blue. This simplest hydrogen chalcogenide is by far
              the most studied chemical compound and is described as the
              "universal solvent" for its ability to dissolve many substances.
              This allows it to be the "solvent of life": indeed, water as found
              in nature almost always includes various dissolved substances, and
              special steps are required to obtain chemically pure water. Water
              is the only common substance to exist as a solid, liquid, and gas
              in normal terrestrial conditions.
            </p>
            <p>
              Along with oxidane, water is one of the two official names for the
              chemical compound H 2O; it is also the liquid phase of H 2O. The
              other two common states of matter of water are the solid phase,
              ice, and the gaseous phase, water vapor or steam. The addition or
              removal of heat can cause phase transitions: freezing (water to
              ice), melting (ice to water), vaporization (water to vapor),
              condensation (vapor to water), sublimation (ice to vapor) and
              deposition (vapor to ice).
            </p>
            <p>
              Water differs from most liquids in that it becomes less dense as
              it freezes. In 1 atm pressure, it reaches its maximum density of
              1,000 kg/m3 (62.43 lb/cu ft) at 3.98 °C (39.16 °F). The density of
              ice is 917 kg/m3 (57.25 lb/cu ft), an expansion of 9%. This
              expansion can exert enormous pressure, bursting pipes and cracking
              rocks (see Frost weathering). In a lake or ocean, water at 4 °C
              (39.2 °F) sinks to the bottom, and ice forms on the surface,
              floating on the liquid water. This ice insulates the water below,
              preventing it from freezing solid. Without this protection, most
              aquatic organisms would perish during the winter.

            <p>
              Pure water is visibly blue due to absorption of light in the
              region ca. 600 nm - 800 nm. The color can be easily observed in a
              glass of tap-water placed against a pure white background, in
              daylight. The principal absorption bands responsible for the color
              are overtones of the O-H stretching vibrations. The apparent
              intensity of the color increases with the depth of the water
              column, following Beer's law. This also applies, for example, with
              a swimming pool when the light source is sunlight reflected from
              the pool's white tiles. In nature, the color may also be modified
              from blue to green due to the presence of suspended solids or
              algae.
            </p>
            <p>
              In industry, near-infrared spectroscopy is used with aqueous
              solutions as the greater intensity of the lower overtones of water
              means that glass cuvettes with short path-length may be employed.
              To observe the fundamental stretching absorption spectrum of water
              or of an aqueous solution in the region around 3500 cm−1 (2.85 μm)
              a path length of about 25 μm is needed. Also, the cuvette must be
              both transparent around 3500 cm−1 and insoluble in water; calcium
              fluoride is one material that is in common use for the cuvette
              windows with aqueous solutions.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Raman-active fundamental vibrations may be observed with, for
              example, a 1 cm sample cell. Aquatic plants, algae, and other
              photosynthetic organisms can live in water up to hundreds of
              meters deep, because sunlight can reach them. Practically no
              sunlight reaches the parts of the oceans below 1,000 meters (3,300
              ft) of depth. The refractive index of liquid water (1.333 at 20 °C
              (68 °F)) is much higher than that of air (1.0), similar to those
              of alkanes and ethanol, but lower than those of glycerol (1.473),
              benzene (1.501), carbon disulfide (1.627), and common types of
              glass (1.4 to 1.6). The refraction index of ice (1.31) is lower
              than that of liquid water.
